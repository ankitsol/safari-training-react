Code examples and exercises for Safari LiveTraining course.

### Setup

To run all of these examples and exercises, you will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. It is recommended that you look into using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#node-version-manager---) to help simplify installation and management of versions you have installed on your system.


### Examples

For each of the examples in this repository, you should `cd` into them and then install the local dependencies. You can do so with either [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
yarn install

npm install
```

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the each application with the one of the following commands:

```
yarn run start

npm run start
```

The application will then be opened in your default browser, where it will be served at [`localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/)
